rosetta-rs is another approach for discovering relevant Rust crates

Potential criteria for comparison:
- Features
- Runtime performance
- Release binary size
- Debug build times
- Popularity
- Expressiveness via example code

Potential criteria for including a crate:
- Popularity
- Fulfills a unique niche

Submissions are preferred to be idiomatic uses of an API (think "what would a
naive user write") though optimized variants may also be included for
comparison.  This is to help demonstrate the expressiveness of the API and help
people translate from one API to another.

- [lib.rs](https://lib.rs/)
